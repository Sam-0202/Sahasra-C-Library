# Sahasra-C-Library
Languages like C++/Java support classes like BigIntegers allowing developers to utilize numbers with upto a 100 digits. SAHASRA aims to provide support upto a 1000 digits in the C language along with basic mathematical operations (comparison, addition, subtraction, multiplication) and some mathematical functions (Fibonacci series, factorial).

# Objective
Add support for Big Integers (numbers greater than 18446744073709551615) in C along with basic mathematical operations and functions.

# Method

Wrote a function to declare and initialize Sahasra
Write a function to compare Sahasras; returns equal, lesser than or greater than comparisons of inputted numbers.
Implement basic arithmetic operations on Sahasras : Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
Implement applications of Sahasra: Fibonacci number, Factorial, Sort, Search etc.

# Application
Calculate factorial of very large integers
Calculate very large nth Fibonacci number
Calculate binomial coefficient of very large numbers
Perform binary exponentiation on very large numbers or raise numbers to very large powers
Greatest Common Divisor
